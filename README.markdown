This is a simple demonstration application used in the [Jenkins: The Definitive Guide](http://wakaleo.com/books/jenkins-the-definitive-guide) book.

## Building the project

The project is a simple multi-module Maven project. To build the whole project, just run `mvn install` from the root directory.

## Running the game

The application is a very simple online version of [Conway's 'game of life'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). To see what the game does, run `mvn install` as described above, thengo to the gameoflife-web directory and run `mvn jetty:run`. The application will be running on http://localhost:9090.

## Running the acceptance tests

The acceptance tests are written using Webdriver and [Thucydides](http://thucydides.info). They are designed to run against a running server. Run the jetty instance as described about, then, in another window, go to the gameoflife-acceptance-tests directory and run `mvn clean verify`. The test reports will be generated in the `target/site/thucydides` directory.

## For openshift environment

A wildfly template is included `wildfly-j2ee-application-template-no-database.json` in order to deploy it in OpenShift Origin.

The included `Jenkinsfile` will allow Jenkins to deploy the application to OpenShift in a Pipeline by using the image to source (I2S) OpenShift functionality.

#### Running the application

For information on how to prepare an OpenShift 3 Origin environment, refer to: https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app/README.md

If you already have a working OpenShift environment just follow these steps. You will need to have the OpenShift CLI tools installed:

* Login to OpenShift
```
    $ oc login --server=<server_url>
```
* Create a new project
```
    $ oc new-project game-of-life --display-name="Game Of Life on WildFly + Jenkins Application Example" --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3 Origin integrated in an Jekins Pipeline"
```
* Upload the application template. You need to be in the root of this repository
```
    $ oc create -f wildfly-j2ee-application-template-no-database.json
```
* Create the applications with the uploaded template. 
```
    $ oc new-app wildfly-j2ee-application-no-database
```
**NOTE** This can also be done from the web interface by clicking "Add to Project" and selecting the template. It will allow you to change the parameters. 
	
**NOTE** You can also specify your parameters in the command-line by using --param=PUBLIC_URL=test.domain.org, you should at least specify an PUBLIC_URL parameter matching your environment

* If everything went correctly the applications will automatically build and deployed. It will be accessible on the specified PUBLIC_URL

This specific application template doen't have any trigger enabled in order to allow Jenkins to fully control the build and deployment process. To manually build and deploy from the CLI, execute the following commands:

```
    $ oc new-build j2ee-application-build
    $ oc deploy frontend --latest
```

#### Deploying with Jenkins

Once the application is created on OpenShift follow these steps to configure Jenkins deployment to OpenShift

* Install and configure the CloudBees OpenShift CLI Plugin
* Create a Username and Password credentials to login to your OpenShift server
* Create a Pipeline Job and paste the `Jenkinsfile` script on the Pipeline Definition
